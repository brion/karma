# Karma

My circa-1990 QuickBASIC port of [Compute! magazine's game "Karma"](https://archive.org/details/1987-12-compute-magazine/page/n101/mode/2up), originally published for Amiga.

The QuickBASIC port used an external library to make interrupt calls which I don't have handy, but should run as-is in QuickBASIC 4.0 or 4.5 with that library. I have converted the file from binary to text for convenience.

Gonna try making a quickie HTML/JS port for funsies. :D

The original Karma game is copyright 1987 Compute! Publications, all rights reserved, so I hope they don't come after me...
